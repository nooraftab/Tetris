Hi! This is the readme for the GUI implementation of Tetris!

For the sake of not having to refresh text in the refreshView() function, I put the labels in two separate JPanels (with a horizontal BoxLayout). I tried using a GridLayout but that made grids that took up a lot of space, and I couldn't quite understand the API for a GridBagLayout enough to properly implement it!

I noted in my Controller class that the way I created an ActionListener for my timer was adapted from an online source because the Java API wasn't too clear for me, and I found a handy website (linked at the top of the class) from a university that was more helpful! I can assure that the actual code for how the timer was meant to work was written by me. :)
